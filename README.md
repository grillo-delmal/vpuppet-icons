# Virtual Puppet Icons

These assets were created as unofficial alternatives for the [Inochi2D](https://inochi2d.com) project. These were made to distribute in unsupported builds that don't include any branding assets.

The need for this arises because there are some software distribution platforms that don't support sharing files that are not provided under an open license (in my specific case, [Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-approval/#_allowed_for_content) and [COPR](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/user_documentation.html#what-i-can-build-in-copr)). Since the Inochi2D branding assets have [restricted conditions](https://github.com/Inochi2D/branding#conditions-of-use) for their distribution, it is not allowed to share them on those platforms even if the author grants the permissions to do so.

The Inochi2D apps are allowed to be [distributed](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-creator#for-package-maintainers) without any icons or assets, but they would look bland and boring without at least an icon to diferentiate them from other applications in the desktop environmet (personal opinion). I will stop using this assets for this purpose if the official project provides alternative valid assets for this purposes.

This icons were made independently without any affiliation to the [Inochi2D](https://inochi2d.com) project.
